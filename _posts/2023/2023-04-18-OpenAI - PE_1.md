## OpenAI 잘사용하는 방법 

1. **프롬프트를 위한 지침**
2. 반복 프롬프트
3. 요약하기 
4. 추론하기 
5. 텍스트 변환
6. 프롬프트 확장
7. 챗봇 


### 프롬프트를 위한 지침 ([.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Zt8U-2c3oKv2C8TvchM-j3NNdu8ir74l?usp=sharing))

#### write clear and specific instructions (separate sections)

1. use delimiters
    ```python
    def get_completion(prompt, model="gpt-35-turbo"):
        msg = [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
        rsp = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
            model=model,
            messages=msg,
            temperature=0,
        )
        return response.choices[0].message["content"]

    text = "a paragraph or text that you want to summarize"

    prompt = f"""
    Summarize the text delimited by triple backticks \ 
    into a single sentence 
    ```{text}```
    """

    rsp = get_completion(prompt)
    print(rsp)
    ```

2. Ask for structured output
    ```python
    prompt = f"""
    Generate a list of three made-up book titles along \ 
    with their authors and genres. 
    Provide them in JSON format with the following keys:
    book_id, title, author, gnere.
    """
    ```

3. Check whether conditions are satisfied & Check assumptions requried to do the task 
    ```python
    text_1 = f"""
    Making a cup of tea is easy! First, you need to get some \
    water boiling. While that's happening, \
    grab a cup and put a tea bag in it. Once the water is \
    hot enough, just pour it over the tea bag. \
    Let it sit for a bit so the tea can steep. After a \
    few minutes, take out the tea bag. If you \
    like, you can add some sugar or milk to taste. \
    And that's it! You've got yourself a delicious \
    cup of tea to enjoy.
    """

    text_1 = f"""
    The sun is shining brightly today, and the birds are \
    'singing. It's a beautiful day to go for a \
    walk in the park. The flowers are blooming, and the \
    trees are swaying gently in the breeze. People \
    are out and about, enjoying the lovely weather. \
    Some are having picnics, while others are playing \
    games or simply relaxing on the grass. It's a\
    perfect day to spend time outdoors and appreciate the \
    beauty of nature.

    prompt = f"""

    text = text_1 
    text = text_2

    prompt = f"""
    You will be provided with text delimited by triple quotes.
    If it contains a sequence of instructions, \
    re-write those instructions in the following format:
    
    Step 1 -
    Step 2 -
    Step N - ...

    If the text does not contain a sequence of instructions, \
    then simply write \"No steps provided. \"

    \"\"\"{text}\"\"\"
    """

    response = get_completion (prompt)
    print("Completion for Text 1:")
    print (response)

    response = get_completion (prompt)
    print("Completion for Text 2:")
    print (response)


    ```
4. Few-shot prompting (Give successful examples of completing tasks then ask model to perform the task)
    ```python
    prompt = f"""
    Your task is to answer in a consistent style.
    <child>: Teach me about patience.
    <grandparent>: The river that carves the deepest \
    valley flows from a modest spring; the \
    grandest symphony originates from a single note; \
    the most intricate tapestry begins with a solitary thread.
    <child>: Teach me about resilience.
    """

    ```

#### Give the model time to think

1. Specify the steops to complete a task 
    ```python
    text = f"""
    In a charming village, siblings Jack and Jill set out on \ 
    a quest to fetch water from a hilltop \ 
    well. As they climbed, singing joyfully, misfortune \ 
    struck—Jack tripped on a stone and tumbled \ 
    down the hill, with Jill following suit. \ 
    Though slightly battered, the pair returned home to \ 
    comforting embraces. Despite the mishap, \ 
    their adventurous spirits remained undimmed, and they \ 
    continued exploring with delight.
    """
    # example 1
    prompt_1 = f"""
    Perform the following actions: 
    1 - Summarize the following text delimited by triple \
    backticks with 1 sentence.
    2 - Translate the summary into French.
    3 - List each name in the French summary.
    4 - Output a json object that contains the following \
    keys: french_summary, num_names.

    Separate your answers with line breaks.

    Text:
    ```{text}```
    """
    response = get_completion(prompt_1)
    print("Completion for prompt 1:")
    print(response)
    ```
    ```python
    prompt_2 = f"""
    Your task is to perform the following actions: 
    1 - Summarize the following text delimited by 
    <> with 1 sentence.
    2 - Translate the summary into French.
    3 - List each name in the French summary.
    4 - Output a json object that contains the 
    following keys: french_summary, num_names.

    Use the following format:
    Text: <text to summarize>
    Summary: <summary>
    Translation: <summary translation>
    Names: <list of names in Italian summary>
    Output JSON: <json with summary and num_names>

    Text: <{text}>
    """
    response = get_completion(prompt_2)
    print("\nCompletion for prompt 2:")
    print(response)
    ```

2. Instruct the model to work out its own solution before rushing to a conclusion 
    ```python
    prompt = f"""
    Determine if the student's solution is correct or not.

    Question:
    I'm building a solar power installation and I need \
    help working out the financials. 
    - Land costs $100 / square foot
    - I can buy solar panels for $250 / square foot
    - I negotiated a contract for maintenance that will cost \ 
    me a flat $100k per year, and an additional $10 / square \
    foot
    What is the total cost for the first year of operations 
    as a function of the number of square feet.

    Student's Solution:
    Let x be the size of the installation in square feet.
    Costs:
    1. Land cost: 100x
    2. Solar panel cost: 250x
    3. Maintenance cost: 100,000 + 100x
    Total cost: 100x + 250x + 100,000 + 100x = 450x + 100,000
    """
    response = get_completion(prompt)
    print(response)
    ```

    ```python
    prompt = f"""
    Your task is to determine if the student's solution \
    is correct or not.
    To solve the problem do the following:
    - First, work out your own solution to the problem. 
    - Then compare your solution to the student's solution \ 
    and evaluate if the student's solution is correct or not. 
    Don't decide if the student's solution is correct until 
    you have done the problem yourself.

    Use the following format:
    Question:
    \```

    Student's solution:
    \```
    student's solution here
    \```
    Actual solution:

    steps to work out the solution and your solution here
    \```
    Is the student's solution the same as actual solution \
    just calculated:
    \```
    yes or no

    Student grade:

### model limitations
1. hallucination : in order to reduce hallucinations, fist find relevant information, then answer the qeustion based on the relevant information.
