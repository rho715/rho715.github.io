## OpenAI 잘사용하는 방법 

1. [프롬프트를 위한 지침](https://rho715.github.io/openai/OpenAI-PE_1/)
2. **반복 프롬프트**
3. **요약하기**
4. [추론하기](https://rho715.github.io/openai/OpenAI-PE_3/)
5. [텍스트 변환](https://rho715.github.io/openai/OpenAI-PE_4/)
6. [프롬프트 확장](https://rho715.github.io/openai/OpenAI-PE_5/)

### 반복 프롬프트 ([ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1kolj2HPakI43DU3BOug_wEP-wQ_UCAq4?usp=sharing))

-  Idea -> Implementation (code/data) -> Experimental result -> Error Analysis 
- AI doesn't really work well with numbers 
- Iterative Process 
    1. Try something 
    2. Analyze where the result does nto give what you want 
    3. Clarify instructions, give more time to think 
    4. Refine prompts with a batch of examples 

### 요약하기 ([ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1KmtI-ZI3bY_eWiXpqMw_TeNxz53smCu2?usp=sharing))

```python
prod_review = """
Got this panda plush toy for my daughter's birthday, \
who loves it and takes it everywhere. It's soft and \ 
super cute, and its face has a friendly look. It's \ 
a bit small for what I paid though. I think there \ 
might be other options that are bigger for the \ 
same price. It arrived a day earlier than expected, \ 
so I got to play with it myself before I gave it \ 
to her.
