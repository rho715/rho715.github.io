## OpenAI 잘사용하는 방법 

1. 프롬프트를 위한 지침
2. 반복 프롬프트
3. 요약하기
4. 추론하기
5. **텍스트 변환**
6. 프롬프트 확장
7. 챗봇 


### 텍스트 변환 ([ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/110CDWTIkuBMCQcAnzGvVSyK4oDnXMVia?usp=sharing))

- Translation 
    ```python
    user_messages = [
    "La performance du système est plus lente que d'habitude.",  # System performance is slower than normal         
    "Mi monitor tiene píxeles que no se iluminan.",              # My monitor has pixels that are not lighting
    "Il mio mouse non funziona",                                 # My mouse is not working
    "Mój klawisz Ctrl jest zepsuty",                             # My keyboard has a broken control key
    "我的屏幕在闪烁"                                               # My screen is flashing
    ] 
    for issue in user_messages:
    prompt = f"Tell me what language this is: ```{issue}```"
    lang = get_completion(prompt)
    print(f"Original message ({lang}): {issue}")

    prompt = f"""
    Translate the following  text to English \
    and Korean: ```{issue}```
    """
    response = get_completion(prompt)
    print(response, "\n")
    ```
    ```

- Writing (changing tones)
    - formal vs informal 
    - slang -> business 
- Input / Output Formats 
    ```python
    data_json = { "resturant employees" :[ 
        {"name":"Shyam", "email":"shyamjaiswal@gmail.com"},
        {"name":"Bob", "email":"bob32@gmail.com"},
        {"name":"Jai", "email":"jai87@gmail.com"}
    ]}

    prompt = f"""
    Translate the following python dictionary from JSON to an HTML \
    table with column headers and title: {data_json}
    """
    response = get_completion(prompt)
    print(response)
    from IPython.display import display, Markdown, Latex, HTML, JSON
    display(HTML(response))
    ```
- Grammar & Spelling Check 
    ```python
    text = [ 
    "The girl with the black and white puppies have a ball.",  # The girl has a ball.
    "Yolanda has her notebook.", # ok
    "Its going to be a long day. Does the car need it’s oil changed?",  # Homonyms
    "Their goes my freedom. There going to bring they’re suitcases.",  # Homonyms
    "Your going to need you’re notebook.",  # Homonyms
    "That medicine effects my ability to sleep. Have you heard of the butterfly affect?", # Homonyms
    "This phrase is to cherck chatGPT for speling abilitty"  # spelling
    ]
    for t in text:
        prompt = f"""Proofread and correct the following text
        and rewrite the corrected version. If you don't find
        and errors, just say "No errors found". Don't use 
        any punctuation around the text:
        ```{t}```"""
        response = get_completion(prompt)
        print(response)
    ```
    ```python
    text = f"""
    Got this for my daughter for her birthday cuz she keeps taking \
    mine from my room.  Yes, adults also like pandas too.  She takes \
    it everywhere with her, and it's super soft and cute.  One of the \
    ears is a bit lower than the other, and I don't think that was \
    designed to be asymmetrical. It's a bit small for what I paid for it \
    though. I think there might be other options that are bigger for \
    the same price.  It arrived a day earlier than expected, so I got \
    to play with it myself before I gave it to my daughter.
